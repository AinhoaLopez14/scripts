# Genomic Scripts
Welcome to my GitHub! I am currently finishing my master's thesis in IMBRsea master, and I am working with marine genomics. I've been working in that field since the last year of my bachelor's, so I've created some useful scripts for my genomic data, which could also be useful for you!
# SNPs_classification.sh: The script aims to classify the SNPs you obtain depending on where they are located in the genome: exons, introns or intergenic regions, so you can focus on the ones you're interested in.
# Loci_classification.sh: The script aims to count the loci that are classified following another script (see https://github.com/EvolutionaryGenetics-UB-CEAB/restrictionEnzimes.git).
