# Genomic Scripts
Welcome to my GitHub! I am currently finishing my master's thesis of IMBRsea master, and I am working with marine genomics. I've been working on that field since my last year of bachelor's, so I've created some useful scripts for my genomic data, which could be also useful for you!
